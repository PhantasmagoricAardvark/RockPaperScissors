Building a game of rock, paper, scissors with JavaScript and playing it on the console. 


The most difficult part was getting the function computerPlay() to return a value (rock, paper or scissors) that computerSelection could take and send to the playRound functions. The solution to this was to change the function computerPlay() to return n as "rock", "paper", or "scissors" instead of console.logging them.
